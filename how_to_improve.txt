Things we can do to improve the solution:

1. Outlier Detection
	• This can be further improved	

2. Feature Engineering

2.1 Enhanced Time-Based Features
	•	Add advanced temporal features, such as:
	•	Lag features for 7, 14, 21 days.
	•	Rolling statistics like median, variance, standard deviation, etc.
	•	Cumulative sales over time.
	•	Indicators for week of month, year-over-year trends, etc.

2.2 Inventory Features
	•	Use inventory data to create features like:
	•	Days of inventory left.
	•	Stock-out indicators (when inventory = 0).
	•	Ratios of inventory to sales (if possible).

2.3 Calendar-Specific Features
	•	Include specific event-related features:
	•	Boolean columns for holidays, weekends, seasonal spikes (e.g., Black Friday).
	•	Count of days since or until the next holiday.

2.4 External Data
	•	If allowed, integrate external data (weather, promotions, etc.) that may impact sales.
	•	If not directly usable, try approximations like binary weather flags (rainy/sunny).

3. Advanced Modeling Approaches

3.1 Time Series Modeling
	•	Explore advanced time-series methods:
	•	ARIMA/SARIMA/SARIMAX models.
	•	Prophet for seasonal trends.
	•	**

3.1. Time Series Modeling** (Continued)
	•	ARIMA/SARIMA/SARIMAX for capturing seasonality and trends.
	•	Prophet by Facebook, which handles seasonal patterns and holiday effects.
	•	Vector AutoRegression (VAR) if modeling interactions between multiple products or stores.

3.2 Machine Learning Models
	•	Train models like:
	•	Gradient Boosting Models (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost): Perform well on tabular data.
	•	Random Forests: For baseline comparison.
	•	Neural Networks: Specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time-series data.
	•	Use cross-validation schemes specific to time-series (e.g., expanding window or walk-forward validation) to avoid data leakage.

3.3 Multi-Target Forecasting
	•	Group IDs into clusters (e.g., similar sales trends) and use multi-task learning models.

4. Feature Importance and Selection
	•	Use feature importance plots (e.g., SHAP values for tree-based models) to understand the significance of your features.
	•	Reduce features to only those that significantly improve accuracy, improving generalization.

5. Regularization and Hyperparameter Optimization
	•	Perform hyperparameter tuning using grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization (e.g., Optuna).
	•	Use regularization to avoid overfitting:
	•	Ridge/Lasso regression for linear models.
	•	Regularization parameters in gradient boosting frameworks.

6. Validation Strategy
	•	Ensure the validation approach mimics the real-world scenario. For example:
	•	Instead of using the last 14 days for validation, try rolling validation (e.g., multiple smaller holdouts).
	•	Align weights in validation (from test_weights) to match the test evaluation.

7. Final Predictions and Ensembling
	•	Combine multiple models using ensembling methods:
	•	Simple averages of predictions from different models.
	•	Stacking: Train a meta-model on predictions from base models.
	•	Use different models for specific product clusters or categories.

8. Post-Processing
	•	Ensure predictions are consistent and logical:
	•	Negative sales predictions should be set to 0.
	•	Apply business logic to adjust forecasts for extreme cases (e.g., unusually high demand).

9. Monitoring Performance
	•	Regularly compare validation Weighted MAE with test results.
	•	Investigate significant discrepancies to refine your model further.

10. Tools and Techniques
	•	Use efficient computation libraries like Dask or RAPIDS to speed up large-scale data processing.
	•	Consider implementing incremental learning techniques if the data is too large to handle at once.
